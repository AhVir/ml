# 📂 Machine Learning Algorithm Visualizer

This repository contains an interactive web-based platform designed to **visualize machine learning algorithms step-by-step**.  
The main goal of this project is to help students, beginners, and educators understand the internal workings of common ML algorithms through **clear, animated, and intuitive visual simulations**.

The website is hosted on **GitHub Pages**:

## Purpose of This Project

During my machine learning course, I realized that many algorithms are easy to understand theoretically but much harder to **visualize**.  
For example, in algorithms like **K-Means Clustering**, concepts such as centroid initialization, distance calculation, and iterative updates become far clearer when seen visually.

So I decided to build this platform to:

- Provide **interactive demonstrations** of ML algorithms  
- Make learning ML more intuitive and engaging  
- Help classmates and juniors learn through visualization  
- Enable faculty members to **use these simulations in class**  
- Build a long-term project that expands as I learn new algorithms

## 🛠 What This Project Provides

Each algorithm will have:

- A dedicated page  
- Interactive controls (inputs, sliders, dataset options)  
- Step-by-step visualization of the algorithm’s internal process  
- Dynamic plots and animations  
- Clear explanations of each step  

The first implemented algorithm is:

### ✔ K-Means Clustering
- Random centroid initialization  
- Euclidean distance calculation  
- Cluster assignment  
- Centroid recomputation  
- Iterative visualization until convergence

## ➤ Future Plans

As I progress through my ML course, I will continue adding more algorithms, such as:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Linear Regression (Gradient Descent visualization)  
- Logistic Regression  
- PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)  
- DBSCAN  
- Decision Trees  
- Support Vector Machines  
- And more…  

This repository will grow into a complete **ML Algorithm Interactive Learning Hub**.
